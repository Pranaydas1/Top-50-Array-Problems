# Subarray with Given Sum

An algorithm to find a subarray with a given sum in an unsorted array.

## Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array `A` of positive integers, find a continuous subarray that adds up to a given number `S` and return the left and right indices (1-based indexing) of that subarray. In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray indices that come first when moving from left to right.

### Example

Input:
N = 5, S = 12
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 7, 5}

Output:
Subarray with sum 12 is found from index 2 to 4.
