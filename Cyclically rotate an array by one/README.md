# Rotate Array by One Position Clockwise

## Problem Statement

You are given an array, and your task is to rotate the array by one position in the clockwise direction.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:**
  - N = 5
  - A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- **Output:**
  - 5 1 2 3 4

**Example 2:**

- **Input:**
  - N = 8
  - A[] = {9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3}
- **Output:**
  - 3 9 8 7 6 4 2 1

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `rotate()` which takes the array `A[]` and its size `N` as inputs and modifies the array in place.
