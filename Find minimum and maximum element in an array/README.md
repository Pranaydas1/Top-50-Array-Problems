# Find Minimum and Maximum Elements in an Array

## Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of size `N` of integers, your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:**
  - N = 6
  - A[] = {3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167}
- **Output:**
  - Minimum: 1
  - Maximum: 10000
- **Explanation:**
  - The minimum and maximum elements of the array are 1 and 10000.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:**
  - N = 5
  - A[]  = {1, 345, 234, 21, 56789}
- **Output:**
  - Minimum: 1
  - Maximum: 56789
- **Explanation:**
  - The minimum and maximum elements of the array are 1 and 56789.

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `getMinMax()` which takes the array `A[]` and its size `N` as inputs and returns the minimum and maximum elements of the array.

## How to Use the `getMinMax` Function

1. **Include the Function:** To use the `getMinMax` function in your C program, include it in your code.

2. **Call the Function:** To find the minimum and maximum elements in your array, call the `getMinMax` function and provide it with the array `A[]` and its size `N` as arguments.

3. **Receive the Result:** The function will return a `struct MinMax` that contains both the minimum and maximum elements.

4. **Access the Results:** Access the minimum and maximum elements using the `min` and `max` fields of the returned struct.

5. **Review the Provided Solutions:** If you're looking for example solutions, you can review the code files provided in the repository. These solutions demonstrate how to find the minimum and maximum elements in an array.
